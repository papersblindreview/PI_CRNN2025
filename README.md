# PI_CRNN2025

Supplemental codes for "A Physics-Informed Convolutional Long Short Term Memory Statistical Model for Fluid Thermodynamics Simulations".

There are three scripts:

1) functions.py contains helper functions to load and preprocess the data
2) cae_model.py contains code to run the CAE
3) pi_crnn_model.py contains code to run the spatiotemporal model, conditional on the trained CAE
